Description: Visualizing crystal structures and electron diffraction patterns.  It provides functions cry_demo() and dp_demo() to load a file in CIF formats (Crystallographic Information Framework) and display crystal structure and electron diffraction pattern.  The function dp_demo() also performs powder diffraction simulation and saves the results to a file in the working directory.  The package has been tested on several platforms, including Linux on Crostini with a Core™ m3-8100Y Chromebook, I found that even on this low-powered platform, the performance was acceptable.
